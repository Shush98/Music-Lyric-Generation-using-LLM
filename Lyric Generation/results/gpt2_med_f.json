The second time in a row, that is. This is the first time that Ive ever entered a contest, so well, congratulations!!! If you werent so busy, you could look up the raps here [Pre 1] This is how theyre known in my country. These rappers, they call them the old school hip hop rappers. They use to have a very clear style, but they became too commercial, so they became the rap game to play. But, with the recent trend to be trendy, rappers are a lot more hip hop, so they are becoming a parody of hiphop, to say the least. When theyre talking to their fans, theyre looking for them to join in. Which means that theyre losing respect in the rap game.
